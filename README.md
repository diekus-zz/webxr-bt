# WebXR + Web Bluetooth demo

A demo by Diego González-Zúñiga and Peter O'Shaughnessy, presented at GDG DevFest Ukraine and Heapcon. A web-based VR experience which uses realtime sensor data from a Nordic Thingy, a small multi-sensor device accessible via Bluetooth Low Energy.

The virtual world adapts in real-time to our physical world:

* The amount of rain is linked to the  real-world humidity percentage that we obtain from the Thingy 🌧️
* The background lighting constantly adapts to the value we receive from the colour sensor 🔦
* The central object in the scene - a parrot - nods along according to the orientation data 🐦
* And finally - as a fun bonus - if you press the button on the Thingy, the parrot responds with a sqwawk! 🗯️
